## Darrien's Website

This is just my test website I've created via GitHub. I created this website through my ACE class (Advanced Computer Engineering) at the Career and Technology Center at Fort Osage.

Scrolling through this website you will see I did my best to make changes and understand the coding behind my website without breaking it like I do allot of things.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/XxDjmiller2014xX/XxDjmiller2014xX.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
